# 210CT - Programming Algorithms and Data Structures

Here you will find all my solutions to the tasks given out for labs, for the module 210CT - Programming Algorithms and Data Structures. All my solutions will be in C++ 11 with both the basic and advanced attempted, I have tried to limited the use of C++ in built functions and showed the manual method instead such as SQRT. Below you will find the index of the week’s topics.

•	Week 2 – Pseudocode and Big O notation  
•	Week 3 – Recursion and String Algorithms  
•	Week 4 – Searching and Sorting
