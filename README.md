# 210CT - Programming Algorithms and Data Structures

Here you will find all my solutions to the tasks given out for labs, for the module 210CT - Programming Algorithms and Data Structures. All my solutions will be in C++ 11 with both the basic and advanced attempted, I have tried to limited the use of C++ in built functions and showed the manual method instead such as SQRT. Below you will find the index of the week’s topics.

•	Week 1

1. Write a function that randomly shuffles an array of integers and explain the rationale behind its implementation.
2. Count the number of trailing 0s in a factorial number.

• Week 2

3. Write the pseudocode for a function which returns the highest perfect square which is less or equal to its parameter (a positive integer). Implement this in a programming language of your choice.
4. Look back at last week's tasks. Describe the run-time bounds of these algorithms using Big O notation.
5. Write the pseudocode corresponding to functions for addition, subtraction and multiplication of two matrices, and then compute A=B*C –2*(B+C), where B and C are two quadratic matrices of order n. What is the run-time?

• Week 3

6. Write the pseudocode and code for a function that reverses the words in a sentence. Input: "This is awesome" Output: "awesome is This". Give the Big O notation.
7. Write a recursive function (pseudocode and code) to check if a number n is prime (hint: check whether n is divisible by any number below n).
8. Write a recursive function (pseudocode and code) that removes all vowels from a given string s. Input: "beautiful" Output: "btfl".

• Week 4

1. Adapt the binary search algorithm so that instead of outputting whether a specific value was found, it outputs whether a value within an interval (specified by you) was found. Write the pseudocode and code and give the time complexity of the algorithm using the Big O notation.
Example input: L = [2,3,5,7,9,13] low= 10 high = 14 Output: True

• Week 5

9. Given a sequence of n integer numbers, extract the sub-sequence of maximum length which is in ascending order.

10. Based on the Python code or the C++ code provided in class as a starting point, implement the double linked list node delete function.

• Week 6

11. Implement TREE_SORT algorithm in a language of your choice, but make sure that the INORDER function is implemented iteratively.

• Week 7

12. Write the pseudocode for an unweighted graph data structure. You either use an adjacency matrix or an adjacency list approach. Also, write a function to add a new node and a function to add an edge. Following that, implement the graph you have designed in the programming language of your choice. You may use your own linked list from previous labs, the STL LL, or use a simple fixed size array (10 elements would be fine).
13. Implement BFS and DFS traversals for the above graph. Save the nodes traversed in sequence to a text file.

• Week 8

14. Implement Dijkstra’s algorithm for a weighted graph data structure (you have to update your previous data structure so that it can deal with weights).
